# game.py

# Goals:
#   - Initialize and manage the overall game state.
#   - Create and manage the player object.
#   - Load and manage the current game map.
#   - Handle the main game loop (updating game logic, handling input).
#   - Manage game time (if applicable).
#   - Interact with other game systems (combat, inventory, quests, etc.).
#   - Coordinate saving and loading of the game.

# Interactions:
#   - app.py: The App class creates the Game instance.
#   - player.py: Creates and manages the Player object.
#   - world.py: Loads and updates the game world (map).
#   - combat.py: Initiates and manages combat encounters.
#   - inventory.py: Accesses and modifies the player's inventory.
#   - quests.py: Updates quest progress.
#   - ui/screens/game_screen.py: Provides input to the game and receives data to display.
#   - save_load.py: Saves and loads the game state.
#   - entity.py (potentially): If you have other entities besides the player, Game manages them.
#   - utils.py: May use utility functions (e.g., for loading data, pathfinding).

# Example Structure:
class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        self.player = Player(name="Hero", x=10, y=10)  # Initialize the player.
        self.world = World()  # Initialize the world.
        self.is_running = True # Control the game loop.
        # ... other game state variables (e.g., current_map, game_time) ...

    def update(self, dt):
        # Main game loop logic.
        if not self.is_running:
          return

        # 1. Handle Input (from the UI, eventually)
        #    Example (replace with actual input handling):
        #    player_input = get_input()
        #    if player_input == "move_up":
        #        self.player.move(0, -1)
        # ...

        # 2. Update Player
        self.player.update(dt)


        # 3. Update World
        self.world.update(dt)

        # 4. Check for Combat (example)
        #    if check_for_combat(self.player, self.world):
        #        self.start_combat()

        # 5. Update other systems (quests, inventory, etc.)
        # ...

    def start_combat(self):
      #Example of how to start combat
      pass
        # combat_instance = Combat([self.player] + enemies_nearby)
        # combat_instance.start_combat()
        # while not combat_instance.is_combat_over():
        #   combat_instance.update(dt) # You might need a separate dt or a way to pause the main loop
        # results = combat_instance.get_results()
        # ... handle combat results ...

    def load_game(self):
        # Load game data from save file (using save_load.py).
        pass

    def save_game(self):
        # Save game data to save file (using save_load.py).
        pass
    def quit_game(self):
        #would set the game state and any clean up.
        self.is_running = False
