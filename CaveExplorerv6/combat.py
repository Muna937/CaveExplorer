# combat.py

# Goals:
#   - Implement the combat system logic.
#   - Handle attack calculations (damage, hit chance, critical hits, etc.).
#   - Manage combat state (who is attacking whom, turn order, etc.).
#   - Resolve combat actions (apply damage, check for death, etc.).
#   - (Optionally) Incorporate skills and abilities into combat.
#   - (Optionally) Support different attack types (melee, ranged, magic).

# Interactions:
#   - game.py:
#       - Called by game.py to initiate and update combat encounters.
#       - game.py might pass in a list of participants (player and enemies).
#       - combat.py might return the results of the combat (who won, remaining HP, etc.).
#   - entity.py (or player.py and potentially a monster.py):
#       - Accesses entity stats (attack, defense, HP, skills, etc.) to perform calculations.
#       - Modifies entity stats (e.g., reduces HP) based on combat results.
#   - skills.py (optional):
#       - If skills/abilities are used in combat, combat.py might interact with skills.py
#         to determine their effects.
#   - utils.py (optional):
#       - May use utility functions for things like random number generation (for hit chance, etc.).
#   - ui/screens/game_screen.py (indirectly, through game.py):
#     - The GameScreen will likely need to display combat information to the player and to allow player actions. It interacts indirectly with the Combat class by receiving data updates that are handed to it by game.py.

# Example Structure (you'll need to fill in the details):
class Combat:
    def __init__(self, participants):
        self.participants = participants  # List of entities (player and enemies).
        self.turn_order = [] # List to hold turn order
        # ... other combat-related variables ...

    def start_combat(self):
        # Initialize combat (e.g., determine turn order).
        self.determine_turn_order()
        pass

    def determine_turn_order(self):
      #Determine the order of combat.
      pass

    def update(self, dt):
        # Update the combat state (e.g., handle each entity's turn).
        pass

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender):
        # Calculate the damage dealt by the attacker to the defender.
        pass

    def apply_damage(self, entity, damage):
      #Apply damage to the entity
      pass

    def is_combat_over(self):
        # Check if combat is over (e.g., all enemies defeated, or player defeated).
        pass

    def get_results(self):
        # Return the results of the combat.
        pass

    def handle_player_action(self, action, target):
      #handle the players actions during combat
      pass
